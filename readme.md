# ðŸŽ§ PlayWise: Smart Playlist Engine (Hackathon Project)

Built for the PlayWise Hackathon, this C++ project simulates a full-featured playlist engine using only core Data Structures and Algorithms â€” no backend, no frameworks, just logic.

## ðŸš€ Features (Modules)

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Playlist Engine (DLL)** | Add, delete, move, and reverse songs using a Doubly Linked List for O(1) operations |
| **2. Playback History (Stack)** | Undo last played song via LIFO behavior |
| **3. Song Rating Tree (BST)** | Insert songs by rating (1â€“5), grouped in tree nodes |
| **4. Instant Lookup (HashMap)** | Search songs by ID or title in O(1) |
| **5. Sorting Module** | Sort playlist by title or duration (asc/desc) |
| **6. Playback Optimization** | Pointer-based speed, no deep copies, static ID allocation |
| **7. System Snapshot** | Export top 5 longest songs in real-time |
